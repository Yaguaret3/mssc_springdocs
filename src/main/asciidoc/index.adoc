Sample application demonstrating how to use Spring REST Docs with JUnit 5.

`BeerOrderControllerTest` makes a call to a very simple service and produces three
documentation snippets.

One showing how to make a request using cURL:

include::{snippets}/orders/curl-request.adoc[]

One showing the HTTP request:

include::{snippets}/orders/http-request.adoc[]

And one showing the HTTP response:

include::{snippets}/orders/http-body.adoc[]

Response Body:
include::{snippets}/orders/response-body.adoc[]

Request Fields:
include::{snippets}/orders/response-fields.adoc[]
